README:

This script is used to export data from TMS MEM files (output by QTracks) into an excel file for analysis.
Using separate scripts to extract RMT50 (see other script), 
This is for RMTs, SICI and SICF, demographics and exploratory measures
Other script used for plotting and analysis variables...
Input is the MEM files, and an excel file with Demographics taken from source documents.

# File Organization:
# Data files are MEM files exported from QTracks. 
# They are copied from the MergedData/MEM to this analysis folder
# They must be in a folder With a subfolder for each subject:  
#
# setwd("C:/Users/AbrahaoLab/Sync/Abrahao Lab/Abbey Analysis/Analysis/QuARTS2_TMS/1.SourceData")
#
# Sync / Analysis / QuARTS2_TMS / 
# 1.SourceData
#  / 201
#  / 202
#  / 203
#  / ... 
# 	/ QuARTS-201_TX WK3 ... .mem

# 	/ QuARTS-201_TX WK3 ... .mem
# 	/ QuARTS-201_TX WK3 ... .mem
#
# Inside each are 40+ MEM files for each session, for each side, for each day and am/pm

Output
# The script creates an excel file (.csv and .xls) to use for further analysis, in SAS or R or choice.
# Raw data folder contains the output, which can be shared on any open source files or RedCap.
# Output folder contains plots
# Scripts folder contains scripts and version history
# The parent folder contains R markdown documents and R project file (which will open to last format for editing)

# Backups
# A copy of these scripts can be found in 2 places:
# Abbey (on Sync) = primary working copy
# GitHub (online) = cloud based backup
# +
# Abbey local (on work ASUS laptop) = physical backup 1
# Abbey USB Harddrive = physical backup 2
# Abbey-Liane shared folder (on sync) = cloud backup 2


Change Log & Notes

1. I had to rename 2 of the 203 files as a quick hack cuz they had TP2 code instead of QP2.
203 > TP2C40920B and TP2C40920B 

2. Changed this file name to correct error - QP2 - was previourlty missing Q
QUARTS-205_BSL D2 LCX PM_QP2C41025D.MEM
